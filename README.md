# PortfolioProjects
Hi,

i have been working on this project quite a while. The project is about the impact of covid 19 virus all over the world. 
We all know that during the panadamic, went through a lot of challenges, adapting to the changes that came with it. 
We lost lots of good people, we lost our jobs, and businesses. 
Bases on this facts, I have been inspired to create this to help us learn how to prevent such disaster in the future. 

The tools i would be working with are spreadsheet, SQL, and Tableau. 

SPREADSHEET

I had to extract the dataset we are using from a datasource.The link here >>>>>> https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.
As we know, there are diffrent types of spreadsheet sorftware, but my focus is on mircrosoft excel for this project. Then i had to extract what i would be needing from the sheet. 
I have decided to work with the Covid Deaths and Covid Vaccinations. This way, we know the the total numbers of covid deaths and the total numbers of people vaccinated 
around the continent. Aside that, we have the oppotunity to forcast the percent population infected during data visualization. 

SQL

To those that might not be familar with SQL, it is a query language used to commuincate with a database. For this project, i would be extracting information i want to use from the files uploaded to the database.
The file uploaded was previously from the one i extracted from the spreadsheet which are the covid deaths and vaccinations. Based on this, I have been able to extract data i want for my data visualization.
I worked on the total deaths vs population scenrios in terms of global numbers, total vaccinations all over the continent, percentage of people infected by the deadly virus and losts of other extractions.

TABLEAU 

Tableau is a type of data visualization used to present or showcase our findings. In this aspect, we are using the queries gotten from SQL to build a dashboard for our audience in order to present our findings. 
In Tableau, as long as it is not paid, you can't directly upload from SQL to Tableau. As a person who love challenges, I had to select each query i want and copy the result, then past them in Ms Excel while saving them. 
Thereafter, i had to to create 4 different kind of sheets in Tableau since since it's 4 types of usuals i want to use to create my dashboard. 

The most amazing part about this whole process is that i got the opportunity to learn, i made mistakes especially when i was creating my "temp table" in SQL. But the more mistakes you make, the more you learn form it and move unto the next. 
I am grateful for this experince. I hope this helps someone out there.
